Industry Codes and Aggregations in the Industry Economic Accounts,,,,,,,,
"Estimates in the Industry Economic Accounts of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) are generally available at three levels of detail: sector (15 industry groups), summary (71 industry groups), and detail (389 industry groups).  For most data products, estimates at the detail level are available only for estimate year 2007 (due to the availability of detailed data from the 2007 Economic Census); however, estimates of gross output at the detail level are also available annually.  This table shows the relationship between these three levels of detail as well as how each level relates to the 2007 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code structure.",,,,,,,,
