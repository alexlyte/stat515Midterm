	</li>

	<li> 
		<h4>How do they interact?</h4>
		<p>The rows present the industries, and the columns display the commodities that the industries produce. Production flows from one industry to another. </p>
	</li>

	<li> 
		<h4>Who do they interact with?</h4>
		<p>Looking across a row, all the commodities produced by that
		industry are identified, and the sum of the entries is that industryâ€™s output. Looking
		down a column, all the industries producing that commodity are identified, and the
		sum of the entries is the output of that commodity.</p>
	</li>

	<li> 
		<h4>Do their interactions change over time?</h4>
		<p>Industries.</p>
	</li>

	<li> 
		<h4>Are there consistent clusters of entities?</h4>
		<p>Industries.</p>
	</li>

	<li> 
		<h4>Are there independent components?</h4>
		<p>Industries.</p>
	</li>

</ul>
